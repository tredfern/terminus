## Research

- Lots of synths / pads... swelling textures
- rhythmic pulses or driving synth bass lines
- horns for more triumphant / optimistic (Star Trek). Strings more intense (Alien)
- Melodies play a role more so in optimistic futures, dystopian or dark universes have a tension of lack of melody

### Blade Runner
  - intro and closing, different styles (Blade Runner)
  - Very tense loose intro, spacey accents the mood of the movie while it's on
  - Closing credits, driving, quick, frantic

### Star Trek
  - So optimistic, horns build flair 


### Alien(s)
  - Very open in the intro, slow tension
  - Not bright, dark, and moody
  - Aliens brings in some oboe/clarinet vibes

### Battlestar Galactica
- Voices / synths for Battlestar Galactica, same building tension / lose melody
  - Switching to tense drum theme
  - Deep piano resonance for some tracks

### 2001
- Amazing for using classical songs in sci-fi story that just fits
- Need to study more [Gy√∂rgy_Ligeti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Ligeti)
