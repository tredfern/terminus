## Session Notes February 13, 2021

- Make sounds quieter on main menu
- [#52](https://github.com/tredfern/terminus/issues/52)
- Added additional log messages to better see what is happening


### Review
- Whether to spy on creating actions or mock dispatch messages
  - Spy allows us to check parameters
  - MockDispatch allows us to see messages

- Improve the view and layout of the messages bar
