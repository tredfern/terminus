### Review
- Whether to spy on creating actions or mock dispatch messages
  - Spy allows us to check parameters
  - MockDispatch allows us to see messages

- Improve the view and layout of the messages bar
- Process turn should have less specific logic so new entities can be added more easily

- ~~Fix setVolume missing from audio source in Moonpie~~
