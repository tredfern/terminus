### Sunday Jan 17
- Camera Improvements
  - Center camera ~around player, when player moves a certain distance from center of screen, start moving camera
- Start adding *stats* to characters
  - Health
- BUG: When enemy decides to move with offset of 0,0 it ends up eliminating itself

  


### Notes
- Drawing map is a slow approach and rendering too much, but not optimizing until switching to drawing actual images
- 97.82% Test Coverage
