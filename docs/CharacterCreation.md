## Character Creation

### Roll Ability Scores
#### Physical
  - **Strength**: Physical force and ability
  - **Agility**: Nimbleness, coordination, motor skills
  - **Endurance**: Stamina, Baseline for physical resistances/determination

#### Mental
  - **Knowledge**: General accumulation of information in topics. 
  - **Intelligence**: Problem solving capacity, ability to learn/absorb new information or make connections
  - **Social**: Ability to fit in with groups, connect with people, leadership


### Skills

Skills will have a base attribute that determines the starting point for the ability and then modified based on the abilities of the character. Untrained skills have a significant penalty

Skills will be organized in categories that help link general abilities together. For example, all combat skills will coordinate together. This will give a general assessment on the abilities of the character in a particular domain.

Categories for skills are: _Athletic_, _Combat_, _Crafting_, _Social_, _Science_, _Engineering_, _Sly_, _Miscellaneous_
(These could likely be simplified in the future but are to provide a large brainstorm list to see how it connects together)
