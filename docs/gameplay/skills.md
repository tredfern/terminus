## Skills
Skills have an attribute that establishes the base ability for the skill. If the character is untrained
in the skill, either a penalty is applied or they are incapable of attempting the skill.

1. Skills have an attribute that defines the base modifier to the skill
2. Skills that can be used without training have a minus modifier
3. Ranks can be added to skills to provide a bonus
4. Skills are rolled and compared to some difficulty target
5. For the sake of flexibility, modifiers can be added to the roll or the target number

### Contested Skills

There is nothing like contested skill rolls. All rolls are handled by the actor, the defender
gets to influence with with modifiers to the roll. 

### Selecting the Target Number

Target numbers are selected by the difficulty of the task. 

Examples: 
1) Using technical complex weapons might have higher difficulty for the task. Maybe a sword made of a beam of light is difficult to use, while a crossbow could be average
2) Maybe hacking a computer system is dependent on the security of the system.
3) Different manuevers for a pilot might have different difficulty
