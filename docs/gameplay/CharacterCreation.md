## Character Creation

### Assign Ability Scores
#### Physical
  - **Strength**: Physical force and ability
  - **Dexterity**: Nimbleness, coordination, motor skills
  - **Endurance**: Stamina, Baseline for physical resistances/determination

#### Mental
  - **Knowledge**: General accumulation of information in topics. 
  - **Intelligence**: Problem solving capacity, ability to learn/absorb new information or make connections
  - **Charisma**: Ability to fit in with groups, connect with people, leadership

#### Spiritual/Universe/Horoscope
  _Possible additional attributes_
  - **Luck**: The fudge factor on almost every roll
  - **Karma**: At times you put karma in the bank, and sometimes you withdraw from it
  - **Fate**: Some randomization of the universe
  - **Heroics**: Something to give the PC a bit extra over all the other entities in the game

### Point Buy Method
1. Characters start with attributes set to 4
2. 4 is the lowest score an attribute can be, 12 is the highest
3. Player has 20 points to spend increasing character attributes
4. Cost is `1 + (abilityModifier * 2)`

### Dice Roll Method
1. Roll stats  Rolls with 2 results of 4 or less are automatically rejected
2. Player selects which set they want
3. Player assigns the scores to attributes of their choice

## Homeworld
Homeworlds will create the _racial_ bonus/modifiers typically seen in RPGs. Being born and living on 
a different planet in the solar system

### Skills

1. Skills are defined 

Skills will have a base attribute that determines the starting point for the ability and then modified based on the abilities of the character. Untrained skills have a significant penalty

Skills will be organized in categories that help link general abilities together. For example, all combat skills will coordinate together. This will give a general assessment on the abilities of the character in a particular domain.

Categories for skills are: _Athletic_, _Combat_, _Crafting_, _Social_, _Science_, _Engineering_, _Sly_, _Miscellaneous_
(These could likely be simplified in the future but are to provide a large brainstorm list to see how it connects together)
