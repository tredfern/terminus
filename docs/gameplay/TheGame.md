
**Start**
At the beginning, you wake up in a room with just a couple of other people/robots something nearby. 
You find some basic gear to equip your character with and learn a little bit about the situation.
The ship has been assaulted and while resistance has been able to hold off the invaders for a while
there is no way that it can last forever.

But first off, just getting some basic scouting information will be essential...

So in your first few expeditions out from the area/camp you will try and find some more information, maybe recover
some useful items or people. 

Aliens will not be launching coordinated attacks on the camp, but maybe some wandering patrols will need to be
dealt with.


**Middle**

As the game progresses towards the middle game, the opponents will become steadily stronger. This will result in
more need to organize you equipment and set out with the appropriate items.

You will have learned some of the goals of the aliens and at this phase should start taking on objectives that hit
back at the aliens. The base should have expanded, maybe you are in control of several close rooms that can
support each other.

Waves of enemies will start assaulting the camp and require your support to fight them off. Setting up good 
defensive gear will be necessary, or there might be a disaster when you return to camp later.


**End**

As the game progresses to the end, it will be about getting the final steps for the ship to have removed 
the alien attackers and get the drives back online to escape. Maybe there is a final battle with the aliens
or an assault on their ship, but in the end you pull away. Maybe it leads to a new adventure on a new planet?
