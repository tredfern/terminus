
* Game needs to have an interest curve that builds through several different acts.


## Start
**Boss**: Drone Commander

1. At the beginning, you wake up in a room with just a couple of other people/robots something nearby. 
2. You are immediately in conflict with a few easy aliens that are attacking the cryogenic facilities. They damage the gear limiting the ability to wake more people up at this time. 
3. During the conflict, you'll find some basic gear and with the help of a couple of other survivors beat off the assault
4. You'll learn from the survivors what they know:
   * Something is attacking the ship, but uncertain where it came from
   * Communication channels are limited. There were some reports of other defenders, a few of which might not be too far away.
   * The aliens are organized and will use patrols to find and root out defenders. Securing the location will be essential to progressing
5. The damage to the other people in cryo-storage will reveal that it will be possible to wake up more of them, but the proper replacement bits need to be recovered. 

**Goals**:
* Scout surroundings to find supplies to build basic defenses
* Find some nearby survivors to boost numbers and get some early boons
* Fight off some early assaults and destroy some nests that are causing issues

**Progressing**
Eventually the player will learn the location of the commander that is putting together the assaults in this section of the ship. By this point the assaults will be getting more troublesome with tougher aliens and more of them. The player will need to make a dash to the Drone Commander's base to take them down. (Or maybe the Drone Commander finally leads an assault on the base because the
defenders have proven too resilient?)

## Middle
**Boss**: Mind-Controller

With the Drone Commander eliminated the player should have learned about some additional defenders that need help. There could be an officer or somebody more important for the player in this group. The tension in the game should reset a little bit and allow the player some time to uncover new materials to build new items, unlock some more advanced technology and get a larger perspective on the ship. This should open up the majority of the areas in the game for the player to explore and interact with.

**Goals**:
* Wake up the majority of the staff in cryo-storage and save more people. The base will likely have expanded to take up many rooms at this point and start to feel more like a village in an RPG at this point.
* Get more advanced weaponry that can keep the player alive and provide a resilient base defense that requires less management from the player.
* Learn that the aliens have started to turn some of the deceased into thralls that are horrific to fend off. Major psychological challenges for NPC players to deal with these in battle. 

**Progressing**:
This will bring together the main elements that are the focus of the aliens


## End
**Boss**: Rogue AI Mastermind

The player learns that in the end this has been some combination of a rogue AI and nefarious corporation that saw an opportunity to coordinate the assault with the Aliens. Maybe the aliens had attacked others in the past but this time the AI wanted to experiment with the merging of various lifeforms together. The AI was behind the knowledge for the Mind-Controller to work and the aliens. Maybe the aliens are not aliens at all but people DNA that has been mutated to become super-soldiers. Some generic thing like that.

The main base should suffer a devastating attack that forces the defenders to abandon their position. Maybe the player can help try and save however many they can by guiding the survivors through some air ducts. (Gotta do the classic at some point right?) And they fall back to a last-stand location. The player will then need to penetrate through the ship to find the location of the AI and shut it down permanently.
