## Inventory Management
Inventory management is kind of tricky. What is the best way to keep track of inventory items?
One option is to just go to a list with duplicates of items stacking. Or maybe we can say that some items
are stackable and those will continue to stack forever. That is one straightforward approach.


Another option, is to use inventory slots. This allows for stacks of items to have a maximum size.
It kind of makes things into a bit of a management issue. If the inventory slots are important it
could be a balance option, but from a technical side it makes things harder.


## Ideas
### Crafting heavy
What if the _usable_ inventory is limited. Like you have just a few slots for gear etc... that can be used on the mission. But there is a "Crafting Bag Of Holding" that takes items that are recovered during the game and converts into the resources that will be necessary to complete the game. 

This allows realism and choices in what do you take on your adventure, but it doesn't require much management for all the other stuff. It makes the other stuff kind of the "reward" for the adventuring.

This is actually interesting, it could be that crafting/equipment opens the slots so there is a decision, do I get better gear or do I improve my ability to carry more gear.

It can also lead to an equipping for the adventure phase, but that basically locks you in for your quest until you return to a safety zone.

## Considerations
- Inventory should not inhibit the gameplay
  - If inventory is a balancing mechanic (You can only carry so much) than managing that inventory should be easy. I should know what I want to keep, what I want to get rid of, and how to do it without thinking or disrupting my quest.
  - If inventory is limitless, than dealing with all the stuff, should be easy as well.
