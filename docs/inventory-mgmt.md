## Inventory Management
Inventory management is kind of tricky. What is the best way to keep track of inventory items?
One option is to just go to a list with duplicates of items stacking. Or maybe we can say that some items
are stackable and those will continue to stack forever. That is one straightforward approach.


Another option, is to use inventory slots. This allows for stacks of items to have a maximum size.
It kind of makes things into a bit of a management issue. If the inventory slots are important it
could be a balance option, but from a technical side it makes things harder.
