# Terminus Game Design

## Concept

An RPG based game/system set in a sci-fi universe. Player is one of a small group of soldiers that
awakens on a ship/space station/moon base to a major disaster in progress. Player needs to navigate rogue robots and 
damaged systems to repair the ship to save the rest of the crew. 

Play styles could vary between more combat expertise, which will increase survivability but might limit exploration
or other skill opportunities. Or maybe using more survival skills which will help with finding supplies and
alternate routes. Or maybe a more skill focus that allows the character more abilities to explore and solve problems.

## Inspiration

**What are some similar projects / games?**
Metamorphisis Alpha
Force 7? - There was this game on the C64 where you had a crew and needed to eliminate all these aliens in various rooms.
Cogmind - similar genre and also sci-fi. Different play styles available and need to keep alert level down.
Dungeon of the Endless - Random generated dungeon of rooms where you are trying to get to the top level
Rimworld - If the game evolves into more of a base-building mechanic
Shadowgrounds - Aliens attacking a base and working through levels to solve/protect it


**What stories, pictures, books, songs, art, or people come to mind when thinking about this game**
Orphans in the sky - I read this book as a child and remember it still. 
Aliens - Both from Newt's survival session on her own to the marines fighting their way in

**Doodle a picture/sketch for the project**

**What is FUN about this project? This can be fun for you to do, and/or fun to play!**
- A game with a clear milestones to completion!
- Ability to add lots of puzzles and interesting combat situations
- Chance to form a solid RPG-style engine to use on future projects
- Chance to introduce mod-able concepts into Moonpie that can be leveraged for future projects

## Create

_Start exploring your creative side. Additional documents will probably be needed for the specific mechanics. This is a chance to start exploring and developing your ideas._

**What themes are possible?**

**What styles are possible?**

**Put together a color palette that fits your mood for this project**

**What emotions should the game invoke?**

**Is there a world? Describe how it works**

**Is there a story? How does it go? What is the perspective? What arc does it follow?**

**Money is not always a goal for projects, but it is worth considering if you are going to make income from this, how might you go about that? Continuous support from loyal fans, sales on a platform, advertisements?**

## Risks

_It is always worthwhile to look out for pitfalls. Explore the feelings about why you would not succeed. Learning to tackle or having a plan to deal with those challenges can be the difference between succeeding and another incomplete idea._

**What are some unanswered questions for you right now?**

**What skills do you need to complete this project successfully?**

**What is the hardest part about this project?**

**How committed are you to the project? What can you do to help stay focused on the project?**

**What additional/outside help do you need to complete the project?**

**What are the ways that the project fails?**

**How big does the project feel?**

**What is SCARY about this project?**

**What dependencies exist for this project? Are you working on this with multiple people? Do you need a specific library or technology to be released?**

## Breaking it Down

_Time to start breaking down your idea to get some milestones and steps together. This is where your thinking needs to turn to action._

### Scoping
_Describe the elements of the game/project that are in/out of scope. Use your thoughts from risk combined with creativity to identify the things you really need, and those things that will make the project less likely to succeed._

### Milestones
_Articulate a series of milestones to measure your progress. Milestones don't need to be major releases. Getting a compiled version of a game with a title screen might be a milestone if that is a worthwhile amount of work for you. You can always add more milestones as you learn more about the project_
