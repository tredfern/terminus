# Terminus

Terminus is at this point just a project code name to work under.

## Goals
* 100% Test Coverage
* Easy to mod and extend
* Repeatable game play
* A feeling of a story

## Development

Development is at least partially being performed on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/turtlecoder). 
Streams are currently scheduled for:
Saturdays 13:00-15:00 EST
Sundays 11:00-12:00 EST


## Inspiration

I'm focusing my inspiration on games from the past. Certainly there will be ideas that will leverage current games including things like Dwarf Fortress/Rimworld or Caves of Qud, or Fall Guys (inspiration can and should come from anywhere). These old games captured my mind when I started playing them and finding what made that spark happen is what I'm curious about exploring with this project.

**[The Magic Candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Candle)** - I played this game when it first came out in 1989. It has been a while since I last played it, but I remember being impressed by the mechanics of exploration. This game felt huge. And also the ways that you managed your party. 

**[Darklands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darklands_%28video_game%29)** - A very interesting RPG that allowed a lot of freedom in how you approached the game. But one of my favorite features was that you didn't have to move your character through each individual square when walking through a town. How much time did I waste in most RPG's just clicking from one side of the map to another just to complete a quest? Being able to navigate to locations was fantastic.

**[Ultima V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_V%3A_Warriors_of_Destiny)** - The main Ultima game I played. I loved the variety of towns and quests that linked things together. Getting the magic carpet, was awesome. 

**[Everything Epyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epyx)** - I grew up looking at everything Epyx released. I loved their motto even as a kid of combining strategy with action. Some of their games that are influencing my thinking on this project are, Temple of Apshai Trilogy, Dragonriders of Pern (I'm serious, I played that game a ton),

An interesting tidbit I learned from research is that Epyx did the port of Rogue to non-Unix platforms.
